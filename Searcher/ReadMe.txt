Description:
In this lab, we created a spider (also known as crawler) application capable of indexing the local file system. The spider can crawl through the file system, creating an easily searchable index of file paths, file names & contents (of text files only). The user is able to search this index against keyword, getting back all the file paths where the keyword is encountered.
